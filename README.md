# Java Checkers Project
Personal project I'm working on in order to better learn Java!  
I usually live-stream my work on this progress through twitch (<https://twitch.tv/literatureeee>)

## Project Info
Game takes into consideration all the rules of chess. A piece may move diagonally one space forward to an empty space, or diagonally over ONE enemy piece to an empty space to capture that enemy piece.
A piece becomes a "king piece" after reaching the opponent's first row, and from there the piece can now move backwards in addition to forwards. THIS KING PIECE DOES NOT GAIN ANY OTHER 
SPECIAL MOVEMENT ABILITIES!
